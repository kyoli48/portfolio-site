        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          As a Computer Science major and International Security Studies minor at the University of Notre Dame, I&apos;m constantly seeking opportunities to bridge technical expertise with a deep understanding of what the world needs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences: serving in the Singapore Army as a Sergeant, leading a nonprofit community of 200,000+ students, and founding a boba shop that grew from my dorm room into a thriving business.

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          My decision to study in the U.S. — turning down a full-ride scholarship to read Law at Oxford — was fueled by a desire to immerse myself in its culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Here, I’ve embraced opportunities to explore both STEM and the humanities, honing my skills in software development, leadership, and problem-solving while pursuing projects that combine technology with social impact.

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          Through this website, I share my work, insights, and experiences, and I hope to inspire and connect with others on this exciting journey.
