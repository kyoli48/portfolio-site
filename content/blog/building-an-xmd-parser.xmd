# Building an XMD Parser in TypeScript

Have you ever wanted to create your own document format? In this post, I'll walk through how I built XMD (eXtensible Markdown), a custom document format for my portfolio site.

## What is XMD?

XMD is a markdown-like format that adds structured metadata and enhanced content blocks. It's designed to be:

- Simple to parse
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Extensible for custom blocks
- Compatible with modern React components

## The Building Blocks

Let's start with the core types that define our format:

```typescript
export type XMDMetadata = {
  title: string
  description: string
  date: string
  tags?: string[]
  image?: string
  featured?: boolean
}

export type XMDBlock = {
  type: 'paragraph' | 'heading' | 'code' | 'quote'
  content: string
  level?: number // For headings
  language?: string // For code blocks
}
```

## Parsing Strategy

The parser works in two main phases:

1. Parse metadata between `---` markers
2. Parse content blocks line by line

Here's a simple example:

```typescript
function parseXMD(content: string) {
  const lines = content.split('\n')
  // Parse metadata...
  // Parse blocks...
  return { metadata, blocks }
}
```

## Using with React

The XMD format really shines when paired with React components:

```tsx
function XMDRenderer({ blocks }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {blocks.map(block => {
        switch (block.type) {
          case 'heading':
            return <h1>{block.content}</h1>
          // Handle other blocks...
        }
      })}
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Why Not Just Use Markdown?

> While Markdown is great, sometimes you need more structure and type safety.
> XMD provides that while staying simple and extensible.

## Key Features

1. First-class TypeScript support
2. Structured metadata
3. Custom block types
4. React component mapping

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add more features to XMD:

- Nested blocks
- Custom components
- Better error handling
- Performance optimizations

Stay tuned for more updates!
